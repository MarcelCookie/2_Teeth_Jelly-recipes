    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 packet of gelatin powder (any flavor you like, or mix and match for a surprise)</li>
        <li>2 cups of boiling water </li>
        <li>1/4 cup of sugar (or honey, or maple syrup, or whatever sweetener you fancy)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of lemon juice (or lime juice, or orange juice, or vinegar, or pickle juice, or whatever sour liquid you have lying around)</li>
        <li>Optional: whipped cream, fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, sprinkles, or anything else you want to add some crunch and texture to your jelly</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions: </strong></p> 
    <p>Carefully pour the boiling water over the gelatin mixture and stir until dissolved. Be careful not to burn yourself or spill the hot liquid on your lap. If you do, scream loudly and run to the nearest sink or shower. 
    Add the lemon juice and stir well. Taste the mixture and adjust the sweetness and sourness to your liking. If itâ€™s too sweet, add more lemon juice. If itâ€™s too sour, add more sugar. If itâ€™s too bland, add more flavoring. If itâ€™s too flavorful, add more water. If itâ€™s too watery, add more gelatin. If itâ€™s too gelatinous, add more water. If itâ€™s too confusing, start over.
    Pour the mixture into a baking dish or individual molds. You can use any shape or size you want, as long as they fit in your fridge. You can also spray some cooking oil on the dish or molds to make it easier to remove the jelly later. 
    Refrigerate the jelly for at least 4 hours or until set. You can check if itâ€™s ready by poking it with your finger. If it wobbles like a belly dancer, itâ€™s done. If it splashes like a puddle, it needs more time. 
    To serve, unmold the jelly onto a plate or a bowl. You can decorate it with whipped cream, fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, sprinkles, or anything else you like. Or you can just eat it plain. Itâ€™s up to you.
    Enjoy your jelly snacks with a spoon or your fingers. You donâ€™t need any teeth to enjoy this delicious treat.</p>
    <p><strong>Time:</strong></p>     
    <p>10 minutes of preparation + 4 hours of refrigeration</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
    <p>You can make different flavors of jelly by using different types of gelatin powder and juice. You can also layer different colors of jelly by pouring one layer at a time and letting each layer set before adding another one. You can  create fun patterns and designs by cutting out shapes from the jelly with cookie cutters or a knife. You can also use molds to make jelly animals, flowers, stars, hearts, or whatever you like. The possibilities are endless!</p>
