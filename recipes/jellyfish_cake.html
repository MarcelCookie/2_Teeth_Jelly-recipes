    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p> 
    <ul>
        <li>large fish-shaped cake mold,</li>
        <li>kg of white fish fillets (such as cod, haddock, or pollock. Or any other fish that doesn't have a silly name like flounder or snapper) </li>
        <li>500 ml of milk </li>
        <li>50 g of butter </li>
        <li>50 g of flour (or cornstarch, if you're gluten intolerant. Or allergic to wheat)</li> 
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste </li>
        <li>00 g of cream cheese (or any other soft cheese that spreads easily)</li> 
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>50 g of gelatin</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons of liquid that doesn't have a strong flavor</li> 
        <li>Food coloring (blue, green, and red. Or any other colors that you like)</li> 
        <li>Parsley for garnish </li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p><strong>Instructions: </strong></p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C and grease the cake mold. If you don't have an oven, you can always use a microwave, but be prepared for a soggy and rubbery result. 
    Cut the fish fillets into small pieces and place them in a saucepan. Cover with milk and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 15 minutes or until the fish is cooked and flaky. Drain and reserve the milk. 
    In another saucepan, melt the butter and whisk in the flour. Cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually add the reserved milk, whisking well to avoid lumps. Season with salt and pepper and cook until thickened. 
    In a large bowl, mash the fish with a fork. Add the cream cheese and eggs and mix well. Spoon the mixture into the cake mold and smooth the surface. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden and firm.  
    In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it bloom for 5 minutes. Microwave for 10 seconds or until dissolved. Divide the gelatin into three small bowls and add a few drops of food coloring to each one. Mix well to get blue, green, and red gelatin.

    <p><strong>Time:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Tips: </strong></p>
    <p>You can also add some chopped herbs, cheese, or nuts to the fish mixture for extra flavor and texture. 
    If you don't have jelly beans, you can always use gummy bears
