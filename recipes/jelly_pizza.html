    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p> 
    <ul>
        <li>3 packets of gelatin powder (different flavors for different layers) </li>
        <li>6 cups of boiling water </li>
        <li>Cooking spray or oil</li>
        <li>A round cake pan </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p> 
    <p>  Choose one flavor of gelatin powder and dissolve it in 2 cups of boiling water.  
    
        Stir well and pour into the cake pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. 
        
        Repeat with the other two flavors of gelatin powder, making sure to let each layer set before adding the next one. 
        
        You should end up with a three-layered jelly cake. 
        
        Carefully remove the jelly cake from the pan and place it on a large plate. 
        
        Cut into slices and serve as pizza. 
        
        Enjoy your jelly pizza with a spoon or a straw! </p>

    You can make your jelly pizza more colorful by using different flavors of gelatin powder. For example, you can use strawberry, lemon and lime for a red-yellow-green pizza. Or you can use grape, orange and blueberry for a purple-orange-blue pizza. The possibilities are endless!
