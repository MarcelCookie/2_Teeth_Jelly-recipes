# 2_Teeth_Jelly-recipes
This project is part of my web dev training. The goal is to create a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

To spice things up, I've decided to create a website of jelly recipes only, for elderly people.

The **skills** I will demonstrate:
- create a basic website
- use lists, links, images
- commit messages and create proper commit messages for useful log
