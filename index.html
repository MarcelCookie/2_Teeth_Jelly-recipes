        <!--chewability level-->
        <p>To keep our grand parents safe, lets rate these recipes with their chewability level:</p> 
        <p><strong>ðŸ¦· Soft and smooth</strong></p>
        <p><em>Examples: pudding, yogurt, mashed potatoes</em></p>        
        <p>These foods are ideal for elderly people who have no teeth or difficulty chewing. They are easy to swallow and digest. </p>   
        <p><strong>ðŸ¦·ðŸ¦· Tender and moist </strong></p>
        <p><em>Examples: soup, oatmeal, scrambled eggs.</em></p>  
        <p>These foods require some teeth or gumming to eat, but they are not too hard or dry. They are nourishing and comforting.</p> 
        <p><strong>ðŸ¦·ðŸ¦·ðŸ¦· Chewy and sticky </strong></p> 
        <p><em>Examples: bread, cheese, candy.</em></p> 
        <p>These foods are challenging for elderly people who have few teeth or weak jaws. They may get stuck in the mouth or cause choking. They are best avoided or eaten with caution. </p>
